    <h1>SSHClient</h1>
    <p>
        SSHClient is a software written in Python using GTK+.
        The main purpose of this project is to manage SSH connection via GUI on Linux environments.
    </p>

    <p>
        With some click you are able to add a new SSH connection and open this connection via Shell.
        You also can add tunnels on this connection, so in connection time, the tunnels will be opened.
        And you can edit and delete this connection. So, all connection can be managed in one place, simple
        and fast
    </p>


    <h2>The Application</h2>

    <p>
        The application has a really simple interface, as you can see: <br/>
        <img src="images/SSHClient_001.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Basically, you just need add your connection, inserting your credentials, and clicking in the
        "Connect to Server", to open the SSH connection. You also can open multiple connections at same time.
    </p>

    <h2>Adding a new Connection</h2>

    <p>
        To add a new Connection, you need go to <i>File > New Connection</i>, or just press, <i>Ctrl + N</i>.
        When this window open, you can fill the form and create the connection:
    </p>

    <p>
        Here, you will put the connection info, like host, port user and password, or key if you use it.
    </p>
    <h3>Adding Tunnels</h3>
    <p>In this Window, you also can add the tunnels to this connection, just clicking on "Add Tunnel".</p>

    <h2>Opening a Connection</h2>

    <p>
        It's very simple to open a connection using SSHClient. You just need selected the connection
        on the left list, and click on "Connect to Server". So, a terminal will open connected into
        server. You can open multiple connection, how many you want!
    </p>

    <h2>Editing a connection</h2>
    <p>
        The main purpose of this application, is make the management of the SSH connection more easier, for example,
        change the auth method from password to key.
        So, to edit a connection, you just need select the connection on the left list and click on "Edit"
    </p>

    <h2>
        Deleting a Connection
    </h2>

    <p>
        To delete a connection is more simple than edit one. You just need select the connection on the left list
        and click on Delete. Simple like this!
    </p>
    <img src="images/SSHClient_007.png"/>

    <h2>Settings</h2>

    <p>
        SSHClient considers a few settings, like X11 Forward, Request Compression or Force IPv6. All this
        is configurable. You can access this configuration going to <i>File > Settings</i> or pressing
        <i>Ctrl+S</i>.
    </p>

    <h3>Exporting Connections</h3>
    <p>
        If you want use SSHClient in another computer, but you don't wanna create all server again. You can export all
        connections. It's a simple
        step, you just need click on "Export Connections" choose the file and save! Done! All connections exported, you
        can copy
        for your other computer and import!
    </p>

    <h3>Import Connections</h3>
    <p>
        Import the database of connections is basically the same thing then export, you need select the file and click
        in "Import Connections". Works like a charm! :D
